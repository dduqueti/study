# Consider an array of integers.
# We define the absolute difference between two elements,
# a[i] and a[j] (where i!=j),to be the absolute value of
# a[i] -Â a[j]

# Given an array of integers, find and print the minimum
# absolute difference between any two elements in the array.

# Findings:
# 1. Greedy algorithm: This is a O(n!) where every
#    new input increases complexity dramatically
# 2. First sort the array
# 3. Then compare between closests like this:
# => [-2, 2, 4, 5]
# => |-2-2| then |2-4| then |4-5|
# 4. This makes it a O(n logn) + O(N) = O(N)

# Complete the minimumAbsoluteDifference function below.
def minimum_absolute_difference(arr)
  arr = arr.sort # can manually implement (quick_sort)
